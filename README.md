# CSS Animations and Media Queries

## Design Choices
The purpose of the website is to capture attention and offer interaction to the user. The graphic pieces must connect to each other throughout the design, 
which is why CMYK colors are used because the company is dedicated to selling 3D paintings. The product is applied according to the user's taste, for example, 
on the walls of the living room, dining room, or bedrooms. The header contains a moving paint can that changes color from magenta to black, creating the illusion 
of the paint can being emptied. After the nav, a container was placed with a futuristic image accompanied by a color palette, which generates a visual impact at first sight. 
The background contains an image of a wall and a floor with the intention of communicating where the product is applied. 
Finally, the footer was posted with the respective social networks.
